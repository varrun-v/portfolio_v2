> ### Design philosophy
>
> * This is an **experience-first** portfolio.
> * Prioritize **typography, motion, spacing, and narrative** over flashy visuals.
> * Every section should feel *earned* through scroll, not dumped on the page.
>
> ---
>
> ### Landing / Hero section (critical)
>
> * Minimal, bold hero on initial load.
> * Large expressive typography (name + role).
> * Subtle entrance animation (GSAP).
> * No projects, no skills, no cards on first view.
> * Optional scroll hint or micro-interaction.
>
> The hero must answer silently:
> **“This person has taste and technical depth.”**
>
> --- 
>
> ### Scroll narrative (page flow)
>
> Structure the page as a **scroll-based story** with clear “acts”:
>
> #### Act 1 — What I Do / Philosophy
>
> * Short, confident statements.
> * One idea per viewport.
> * Scroll-triggered reveals (GSAP).
>
> #### Act 2 — Selected Work (Projects)
>
> * 3–5 curated projects maximum.
> * Full-width or immersive layouts.
> * Strong hover states.
> * Cursor shows contextual text like “VIEW”.
> * Each project links to a dedicated detail page or modal.
>
> #### Act 3 — Skills / Capabilities
>
> * No progress bars or percentages.
> * Categorized skills (Development, Design, Tools).
> * Calm, understated presentation.
>
> #### Act 4 — About Me
>
> * Short, human, non-corporate copy.
> * Optional portrait or abstract visual.
> * Focus on mindset, not biography.
>
> #### Act 5 — Contact / Call to Action
>
> * Strong closing statement.
> * Email and social links.
> * No forms unless absolutely necessary.
>
> ---
>
> ### Interaction & motion system
>
> * Use **GSAP** for all animations.
> * we already have our cursor
> * Motion must feel weighted, smooth, and premium.
>
> ---
>
> ### Visual constraints
>
> * Limited color palette.
> * Strong typographic hierarchy.
> * Generous whitespace.
> * No decorative motion without purpose.

>
> ### Typography direction (Modern personality)
>
> * Use a **modern sans-serif type system**.
> * Typography should feel:
>
>   * Confident
>   * Clean
>   * Timeless
> * Avoid playful, decorative, or novelty fonts.
>
> #### Font structure
>
> * **Headings**: expressive but restrained modern sans-serif
> * **Body**: highly readable neutral sans-serif
> * Maximum **2 font families**
> * Minimal font weights (2–3 max)
>
> #### Typography rules
>
> * Headings are large, bold in size (not weight).
> * Tight line-height for headings.
> * Slight negative letter-spacing for large text.
> * Body text is smaller, calm, and readable.
>
> ---
>
> ### Color palette direction 
>
> * Background: near-black (not pure black).
> * Text: soft off-white (not pure white).
> * Accent color: **one muted, modern color** used sparingly.
>
> #### Color rules
>
> * Avoid high-saturation neon colors.
> * Accent color is for:
>
>   * Links
>   * Hover states
>   * Cursor interactions
>   * Small emphasis only
> * No large accent-colored sections.
>
> #### Neutral system
>
> Define a full neutral scale:
>
> * Primary text
> * Secondary text
> * Muted text
> * Borders / dividers
>
> ---
>
> ### Accessibility & polish
>
> * Maintain strong contrast on dark backgrounds.
> * Avoid thin font weights on dark UI.
> * Ensure typography remains readable at all viewport sizes.
>
> ---
>
> ### Integration with motion & cursor
>
> * Typography scale should visually align with:
>
>   * Custom cursor size
>   * Magnetic hover interactions
> * Cursor text uses the same font as body text.
>
> ---
>
> ### Deliverables
>
> Provide:
>
> 1. Font recommendations (with rationale)
> 2. Typographic scale (headings, body, small text)
> 3. Color palette (hex values)
> 4. CSS variables / design tokens
>
> ---
>
> ### Restrictions
>
> * No gradients unless subtle and barely noticeable.
> * No more than **one accent color**.
> * No experimental typography.
>
> ---
>
> **Output expectation**
> The system should feel:
>
> * Calm
> * Premium
> * Confident
> * Aged well even after several years
